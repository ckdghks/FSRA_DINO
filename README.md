<h1 align="center"> FSRA (Modified for Custom Project) </h1>

This repository is based on the original implementation of [FSRA: A Transformer-Based Feature Segmentation and Region Alignment Method For UAV-View Geo-Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09206), published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology.

We modified the original FSRA implementation to better fit our custom project requirements and experiments.
